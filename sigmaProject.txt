We needd use ZERODHA api(zerodha.com) to get price , not ANGEL API.
So, please reference  strategy_05/t2/index.js that i sent by zip .it is for zerodha.

You can look 
        const todate = new Date("2021-08-15 00:00:00");
        const fromdate = new Date("2021-07-25 00:00:00")
        const ohlc_res = await kc.getHistoricalData(trading_token, interval, fromdate, todate,false,true);

it is part of downloading price 

We need get price by Open,High,Low,Close, Open interest,Volume.
The zerodha only provide [open interest].

Good luck.
